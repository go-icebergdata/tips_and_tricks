## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project has its own setup instructions. Navigate to the specific folder and follow the README for that demonstration.

## 💭 Philosophy

These examples follow a few core principles:

- **Practical over theoretical** - Real-world examples you can actually use
- **Clear explanations** - Code should be self-documenting with good comments
- **Complete examples** - Each demo is fully functional, not just snippets
- **Modern approaches** - Using current best practices and tools
